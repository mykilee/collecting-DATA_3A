The dataset that we're working with in this lesson is taken from Hannah Andersen and Matt Daniels's Pudding essay, "Film Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age". The dataset provides information about 2,000 films from 1925 to 2015, including charactersâ€™ names, genders, ages, how many words each character spoke in each film, the release year of each film, and how much money the film grossed. They included character gender information because they wanted to contribute data to a broader conversation about how "white men dominate movie roles."
